The Bits 'N' Pieces Parts Catalog is an inventory system that allows the user to store valuable information about the items that one might

efficiently into an XML file which can remain significantly small in size and produce little to no overhead.  Unlike a database which
requires continuous maintenance, the XML file remains maintenance free...
